  Review / Edit Video Transcript Translations
  *******************************************

  You can review video transcript translations as a learner would, by navigating to a unit with a video and selecting a translation language from the "Translate" modal. This will automatically select the transcript (if available) for the video in that language.

  Alternatively, you can download video transcript translations by going to Studio > Content > Videos, clicking the "..." button next to a video, and selecting "Info". In the modal that pops up, switch to the "Transcript" tab to download any of the available transcripts, including translated transcripts.

  If you need to make edits or corrections to a transcript, you can do that by first downloading the transcript you wish to edit. After editing the transcript, you can replace the existing transcript through the same modal: In the "Transcript" tab next to the transcript you wish to update, click the "..." button and select "Replace". This will allow you to upload an edited transcript in place of the existing transcript.
