  Enabling the Xpert Course Translations Feature
  **********************************************

  Feature availability and language is managed by edX on a per-organization basis.

  To request the Xpert Course Translations feature be available for your courses or to add new language options, please contact edX Partner Support.

  Once the feature is enabled for your organization, course teams can enable or disable translations for individual courses by going to Studio > Content > Pages & Resources > Xpert Translation.

  Clicking the gear icon will open a modal where you can:

  - Turn on or off Xpert Translations, making the feature available or unavailable for learners in that course.

  - Select languages available for translation.

  - Enable video transcripts to be translated to the selected languages.

  Make your changes and then click "Save" to apply them.
