Feature Description: Xpert Course Translations 
##############################################

Xpert Course Translations (XT) is a set of features enabling certain types of course content to be automatically translated into different languages.

Currently supported content types include:

- **Video transcripts**, where an original English transcript exists.

- **Unit page content**, including HTML, Problems, and Polls.

For notes and limitations regarding the supported content types, see :ref:`Feature_Limitations_Xpert_Course_Translations`.

************************************
Selecting a Language for Translation
************************************

If Xpert Course Translations are enabled in your course, a new "Translate" button will appear (pictured below).

Students within your course can click the button to open a modal with languages available for translation.

Once a student has selected a language for translation, supported content types will be translated into the target language.

.. note::
  Content is translated on-demand. The first time a particular piece of course material is translated, there may be a slight delay in page loading before translated material is returned.

Students can view original non-translated content by clicking the "Translate" button again and selecting "Original course language".
